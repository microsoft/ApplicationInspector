works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications
or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion
in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
     trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
     distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
     excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
     following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
     form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
     Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file
     are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
     provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  5. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
     terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
     Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
     conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You
to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.
A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.
"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.

2. Grant of Rights
(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and
    limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free

3. Conditions and Limitations
(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo,
    or trademarks.
(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by
    the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.

    and attribution notices that are present in the software.
(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this

    warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws
    which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
